## Learned so far

### Concepts

**Transaction:**

* changes state of the network
* coasts `gas`
* isn't processed immediately
* won't return value (only a transaction id)

**Call:**

* free (do not coast `gas`)
* does not change state of network
* processed immediately
* will return value

**Smart Contact:**

* bunch of code that is being executed when conditions are met
* perfect for bussines (enforces some type of agreement)

**Blockchain:**

* shared, distributed ledger on which transactions are recorded
* contains whole history 
* `consensus protocol`

**Web3:**
* send changes state of SmartContract
* call does not
